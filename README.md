## Introduction

> It’s important to know what Mother Nature is going to throw at you each day – what if you wear flip flops because it’s sunny and 65 degrees in the morning and then it snows all afternoon (this is Colorado, after all). This application can be used to look up the weather in a US city by using either the zip code or a state/city combo

## Built With

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* React
* Jest
* Enzyme

## Project Requirements
Your app should have at a minimum the following components.

* App
* Welcome
* Search
* Current Weather
* 7 Hour Forecast
* 10 Day Forecast
* Card (used in 7 hour and 10 day)

### Phase One

* Your application should have a welcome page that greets the user.
* The welcome page has a search component.
* Once the desired location is submitted a current weather component should display with the following information
	- the name of the current city
	- the current condition
	- the current day
	- the current temperature
	- the expected high and expected low for the day
	- a summary of what the weather is going to be like that day (“Windy, chance of a few late night showers. Lows overnight in the mid 50s.)
* There should be a way for the user to change location information. Once the location information is changed the weather should reflect the desired location. 
* Location persists after refresh.


### Phase Two

The application should have a 7 hour weather forecast component. Each hour should be a card component and should display
the hour
an image that reflects the weather
the projected temperature
Application should handle when a user searches for a location that is not found by the API. Team should research different ways to handle unfound locations by looking around on different weather and other location searching applications and implement a solution for their project that they find intuitive.
### Phase Three

* The application should have a 10 day forecast component. 
* Each day should be a card component and should display:
* the name of the day
* an image that reflects the weather
* the projected high and low temperature


### Phase Four

* Add autocomplete functionality to your search input
* When a user starts typing in a city/state or zip code display a list of possible suggestions using your completeMe’s suggest function.


### Extensions

* If a user clicks on a specific day on the 10 day forecast the application should display an hourly breakdown of the forecasted weather for a 24-hour period.
* For each hour it should display an image that reflects the weather
* For each hour it should display the projected temperature and the hour
* Add one or two examples of Micro-Interactions found on Dribbble or Behance in your ReadMe that inspired your design
* The application is fully accessible.
* The application can be used without a mouse
